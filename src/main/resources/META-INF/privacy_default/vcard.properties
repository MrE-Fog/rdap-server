#For each attribute you can use the values: 'any', 'authenticated', 'none', 'owner' or a custom user role configured in
#property 'user_roles' at 'configuration.properties'.
#The 'any' value specifies that the attribute can be seen by authenticated and unauthenticated users. [DEFAULT]
#The 'authenticated' value specifies that any authenticated user can see the attribute.
#The 'none' value specifies that nobody can see the attribute.
#The 'owner' value specifies that only the owner of the object can see the attribute (can be used with custom user roles).
#A custom user role value specifies that users with such role can see the attribute (can be used with 'owner' value).
#Custom user roles can be represented in a list separated by commas (',') and can be mixed with the value 'owner'.
#Eg. lang = myrole1, owner, myrole2
